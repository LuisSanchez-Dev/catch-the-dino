## About The Project

This script was made because a client liked a gig I did before, so they wanted something where they could catch/tame and feed dinosaurs for a chance to get points.

You have small, medium and big dinosaurs, each of them with a different chance to appear when taming or feeding.
There is a base prize and depending on the dinosaur size this prize gets multiplied:
* Small dinosaur have a x1 multiplier
* Medium dinosaur have a x2 multiplier
* Big dinosaur have a x3 multiplier

You can edit all the dinosaur names and even change them to be Pokemons or anything you want!
